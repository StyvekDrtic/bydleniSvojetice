    <p>Have you ever known exactly what you want to cook but searched and searched through all of your cook books and had no luck finding that tender morsel that has been making your mouth water all day? Having to settle for something else is so disappointing isn’t it? Or have you been to a restaurant and fell in love with a dish or a dessert but don’t have the money to go there to enjoy it all the time? Well I have got the answer for you, and that is internet cooking recipes!</p>
    <p>You know all of the advantages of computers and the internet by now but let me run through them real quick just to emphasize my point. First its paperless, you don’t have the clutter of cookbooks and cards and other random loose cooking recipes that you have collected over the years.</p>

    <p>Second the search is so much better than paging through each paper recipe, all you do is simply type a small description of what you are thinking and the computer spits out several cooking recipes that match your request. Other things are the incredible access that you gain when you have the internet at your disposal. You can get recipes from the chef’s themselves. You can get recipes from any country in the entire world directly. You can even find the secret recipes from the famous dishes at restaurants that you crave. Sounds like its worth it to make the switch doesn’t it? Even if it would cost you a little money!</p>
    <p>Well the cool part is that many if not most of the cooking recipes on the internet are free. You simply have to search on one of the main search engines and you will get more options than you can handle some times. You can often download the text so that you can have it on your computer filed away in an organized fashion for the next time you feel like making that dish. Often too there is contact information for the person who posted the recipe on the internet for you to contact if you have a question about a certain ingredient or a change that you are thinking about making.</p>
